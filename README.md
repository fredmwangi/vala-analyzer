Vala Analyzer
=============

This script analyzes Vala source files to check for elementary OS coding conventions.

Usage
-----

```shell
chmod +x review.py
./review.py MyFile.vala
```

Disclaimer
----------

It is extremely complicated to fully analyze a source file automatically. Using this script does not mean you don't have to analyze the source code yourself. Use at your own risk.
